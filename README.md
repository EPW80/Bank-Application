# Bank-Application

## Purpose

A program called BankApp to simulate a banking application. 

## Requirements

  When a user runs your program, it should ask for the username and password 
first. Check if the user matches a customer in the bank with the information 
provided. Remember username and password should be case sensitive. 
After asking for the user name, and password display a menu with the following 
options and ask the user for input (Use a While Loop). 

  If the user types D (Deposit Function) Ask the user to enter the amount to deposit. 
Then call the Deposit Function, passing the deposit amount as a parameter. The function should update the Balance. 
Then display the new balance (this should happen by calling the ShowBalance function). Then display the menu again 
 If the user types W (Withdraw Function) Ask the user to enter the amount he/she wants to withdraw.  
Before calling the withdraw function, make sure there is enough balance. Call the ShowBalance function before Withdraw function!! 
Then call the Withdraw Function, passing the withdraw amount as a parameter. The function should update the Balance.  
Display the new balance to the user. Then display the menu again. 

 If the user enters B 
(ShowBalance Function) Display the Balance. If the user enters C (ChangeUser Function)  Ask for the user name and change to a different 
customer.If the user enters A (AddNewUser function) Ask for username, password, and balance. These information will be added to the appropriate 
lists which later on will be transfered to the UserInformation.txt If the user types any other option: Prompt the user that option is invalid
If the user types E then Terminate the program and update the UserInformtion.txt with the correct updated balances.
